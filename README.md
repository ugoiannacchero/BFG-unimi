CIAO
per scrivere un file README uso "vim", per salvare il file uso "esc + :w", per uscire uso ":wq". The "echo" command is used to add a new line with the file, we have to put >> to add it like:
echo "Adding another line on monday" >> READ.ME md

With > we can create the file

While echo, prints the file of the terminal

If I print echo with the symbol >, Linux recognize ">" grab the characters that I put to the terminal and put them where I told him.

For instance

eco "I am just printing a line on the terminal" > this_is_a_new_file.txt

(In this way we created a new file in the directory called this is a new file.txt containint the characters " I am just printing a line on the terminal)
