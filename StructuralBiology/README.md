Here I used py3dmol to use several functions that enable the visualization of ligand-protein docked complexes from PDBs.
During the BFG unimi master I taken part to a Structural Biology Project in which we performed the docking of a small molecule to a protein. The docking was performed through HADDOCK thanks to my groupmates G.C., D.G., and F.P. .

This program consists of multiple files that need to be located in the same directory for the proper execution of each function in the code. Therefore, please ensure that these files are placed in the same directory before running the scripts. The main script, which contains all the functions, is named "structuralbiology_jc.py". Within this file, you will find a concise explanation of the purpose of each function.

To run the code with a different pdb structure ensure to change the path and the name of:
* the variable name and the path of the PDB docked complex
* the name of the ligand residue
* the number of the active residues
